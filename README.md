# Rakoon FASTA

This is a Raku module for parsing FASTA files. This is mainly a personal project to learn about the kind of data that can be extracted from FASTA files, how FASTA files can be manipulated, good module layout, and Raku grammars.

Over time, this will become a fully functional library for extracting information from FASTA files.
